# Base Story: You = the player(s)

You are investigating the murder of the General Store owner Mara in the village of Arrn, just outside of Dawn.
You are
1. An experienced warrior (easy)
2. An agile scout (medium)
3. A young adult on their first quest (hard)
4. A kid with a stick (good luck :P)


As the murder happened last night and no clues were found by the guards during the day, you decided to head there just after dusk.
The gates of Dawn close behind you for the night as you ponder your next steps.

## Difficulty "traits"

1. Half-plate armor and a decent weapon (let the players choose?) + other  equip, good at fighting and just "walzing through" but trouble at being sneaky or acrobatic
2. Gambeson/leather gear, crossbow? and short sword? (again, let players choose?), adept at sneaking and acrobatics, but should need to use that
3. Gambeson/basic gear, one basic weapon (choice), basic fighting skills, needs to rely on available help
4. Normal clothing and a stick with two fresh leaves at the end, no skills. As a werewolf, they become a puppy (aka fighting has to be done with companions or tricks?)

## General Notes

- Offer to describe in cartoon violence if players prefer a less bloody story?
- Combat: describe good actions (that fit the character) for auto success, describe normal or wacky -> roll?
- Win condition (the usual trope): stop evil cultists from ending the world by attracting an elder god (a deer formed from bloody entrails who is not actually evil, just naturally disastrous)
  - Unless of course, the players choose to side with the cultists?
- No need to ask for trust etc, this is "not Minecraft"
- Torchflowers are some kind of drug spread by the cult (they are found in all houses apart from the store and big family home), so npc helpers drop out after helping once in the boss battle
  - If the players spend a long time in that field or harvest a bunch of them randomly, they get affected too

#### Ruff the Tracker:
  - Is a werewolf
  - Will offer to make the player a werewolf at the behest of his patron wolf deity

  - Offers the player a potion that will stop them from going berserk upon becoming a werewolf
    - Not drinking leads to him stopping them physically, but is a bad end because it takes too long
